# Liri-Node-App
Liri, similar to iPhone's Siri, is a node app that takes in parameters for movies, bands and songs, and then after returns relevant data.


Used for search results, the app makes calls to Spotify, Bandsintown and OMDb APIs.   


When running the app in the command line, use the following to find your desired data: 

* movie-this <*movie name here*>
* spotify-this-song <*song name here*>
* concert-this <*artist/band name here*>
* do-what-it-says
